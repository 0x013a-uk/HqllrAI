# HqllrAI — AI Re-Invented
*Adaptive, persona-aware answers on top of Hqllr Indexer.*

HqllrAI delivers fact-first responses with clear provenance. Personas tailor language and depth for learners, professionals, and experts.

## Key Ideas
- **Persona-Adaptive** — speak to a child, a grad, or a PhD with one switch.
- **Fact-First** — answers link back to their origins.
- **Local-First** — works offline against local indices.
- **Composable** — plug in your own corpora and policies.

## Status
> **Preview** – public policies, schemas, and demo UIs ship first; core retrieval logic remains private while we validate.

## What’s Included (Preview)
- Persona policy examples (JSON)
- Demo Q→A flows using mock datasets
- UI prototypes for mobile/desktop

## Roadmap
- [ ] Demo app (queries without ingest)
- [ ] Persona editor (policies)
- [ ] Provenance UI (hashes, sources)
- [ ] Early access SDKs
